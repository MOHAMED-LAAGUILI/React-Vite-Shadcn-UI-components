Magic UI

it required same shadcn configuration 
https://magicui.design/docs/installation/vite

to integrate any componenet
like example
npx shadcn@latest add "https://magicui.design/r/globe"


in any impportation instead of this 
import Globe from "@/components/magicui/globe";

use directly the dir name
import Globe from './ui/globe';

the abbove import its just an example u can change the last dir name "globe" to the name of installed componenet


helpful too site to convert tsx to jsx 
in case of any componenets has been found written by ts
